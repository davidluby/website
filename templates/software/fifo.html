        <p>
            The linked queue is a dynamic data structure that is useful for processing dynamic data sets in microcontrollers. These queues are made up of a
            sequence of nodes and are best described starting at this level.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each node <i>contains</i> at least two things--its value and a pointer. The value of the the node can be assigned to any data type. Now, zoom out
            one step and imagine two of these nodes side-by-side, each containing a unique value and a pointer. 

            There is nothing stopping a node from having more than one of either or both of
            these.
